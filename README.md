# Task-Manager-Mern

This is a full-stack To-Do application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

It allows users to:

Create, read, update, and delete tasks.

Manage tasks with user authentication (JWT).

Store data securely in MongoDB.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building a full-stack web application and connecting a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend.
